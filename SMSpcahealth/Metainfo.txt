Description: 'Employs the principal component analysis to the US health data set which contains reported numbers of deaths in the 50 U.S. states classified according to 7 categories: accident, cardiovascular, cancer, pulmonary, pneumonia flu, diabetes, and liver. Normalizing the data gives equal importance to each cause of death. Not normalizing however, leaves the most prominent role to the variables causing largest number of deaths. Correlations of the first two PCs with the original variables, the screeplot and a scatterplot of the first two principal components are are presented.'
