Description: 'Demonstrates Bayes discrimination rule for car data set which encloses different variables for the three regions, the US, Europe and Japan. Applying the Bayes discrimination rule, an apparent error rate (APER) of 0.2838 is estimated. Obviously, the Bayes discriminant rule leads to better results than ML discriminant rule since it gives large weights to U.S. cars which constitute more than 60 percent of the entire data set.'

Keywords: 'Bayes rule, discriminant analysis, aper, discrimination'
