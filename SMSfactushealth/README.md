Name of Quantlet: SMSfactushealth

Published in: Multivariate Statistics: Exercises and Solutions

Description: performs a factor analysis on the US health data set. The first factor, corresponding to diabetes, cancer, and cardiovascular problems, leads to higher factor scores in Rhode Island. On the other side, these causes of death are less common mainly in Alaska, Wyoming, Colorado, and Utah. The second health factor, positively related to pneumonia flu, has highest estimated values in South Dakota and smallest values in Alaska. The third health factor, strongly positively related to liver, has high values in Florida, California, and New York and small values in Hawaii and Mississippi. Looking at the the geographical codes, it is interesting to note that Florida seems to be a regional outlier from the point of view of the third factor. The most healthy U.S. states are Alaska, Hawaii, and Utah. A table of estimated factor loadings, communalities and specific variances as well as plots of factors and factor scores are presented.

Keywords: varimax, rotation, factor analysis, factor scores, factor loadings, communalities, specific variances, factor model
