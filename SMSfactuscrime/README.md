Description: performs a factor analysis on the US crime data set and estimates factor scores. The data set contains the reported number of crimes in he 50 states of the USA classified according to 7 cateories. A table of estimated factor loadings, communalities and specific variances as well as plots of factors and factor scores are presented. With p-value 0.8257 for the LR test on k=3 factors we cannot reject the null hypothesis of 3 factors to be included. First factor could be as violent assault and murder criminality factor. The second factor is strongly related to larceny, burglary and rape. The third factor is related to auto theft, robbery and burglary. The estimated factor scores for the first factor, murder and assault, seem to be largest in North Carolina. The second factor suggests that larceny is common mainly in Arizona and California. The third factor, auto theft and robbery, reaches the highest estimated factor scores in New York and Massachusetts.

Keywords: varimax, rotation, factor analysis, factor scores, factor loadings, communalities, specific variances, factor model
