Description: 'Applies multidimensional scaling for Swiss bank notes. The Swiss bank note data is transformed into an Euclidean distance matrix of size (200 x 200). An attempt to achieve the original configuration of points is made employing metric MDS. Results are quite similar to configuration from PCA. The scatterplot of two-dimensional projections, however, gives better seperation. A reason could be that principal components are based only on the estimates of a covariance matrix which is wrong if the data set consists of more subgroups.'
