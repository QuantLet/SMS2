Description : 'Performs cluster analysis for US health 2005 data. On the 
transformed data we perform a principal component analysis and a cluster analysis 
employing Eulcidean distance and Ward linkage algorithm. Plots of principal 
components and the dendrogram are presented. After extraction of 4 clusters, 
the principal components with the four clusters (denoted by different colours) are 
shown. The graphs and clustering differs from R due to different algorithms.'

Keywords : cluster-analysis, dendrogram, pca, principal-components, plot, graphical representation, Ward algorithm, euclidean, distance
