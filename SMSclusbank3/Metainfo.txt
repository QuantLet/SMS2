Name of Quantlet: SMSclusbank3

Published in: Multivariate Statistics: Exercises and Solutions

Description: 'performs a PCA and a cluster analysis for 20 randomly chosen bank notes from the swiss bank notes dataset. Centered principal components as well as cluster analysis employing ward algorithm to L1 distance matrix perform similarly on seperating real from forged bank notes. However, the banknote 116 is misspecified by cluster analysis with L1 (Manhattan, City Block) distance. Even ward algorithm with perfoming best on balancing distances and cluster sizes is not able to pass in this example.'
