Description: 'pplies the PCA to the car marks data which contains marks of different car brands for different objectives, e.g. economy, service, value,  price, design, sporty, safety and handling (marks are assigned  as 1 = best, 6=worst). Eigenvalues of the covariance matrix, the proportion of explained variance are presented. Moreover first three principal components are plotted against each other, a screeplot is displayed and the correlations of the first two PCs with the original variables are shown. In addition the hypothesis that the proportion of variance explained by the first two PCs is 85 percent is tested and rejected. Thus the proportion of explained variance by the first two PCs is larger than 85.'

Output: 'Eigenvalues, eigenvectors, screeplot, the first three principal components and the correlation of the first two PCs with the original variables are shown as results. Moreover the hypothesis of variance explained being equal to 85% is tested.'
