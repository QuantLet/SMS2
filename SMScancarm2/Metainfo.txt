Description: 'Estimates the canonical variables for a subset of variables of the car marks data set: X - (price, value), Y - (economy, service, design, sportiness, safety, easy handling). A scatterplot of the second 2 canonical variables are presented. The relationship between the two canonical variables is moderate.'

Keywords: 'canonical correlation, covariance, eigenvalue, eigenvector, singular value decomposition, canonical vector, canonical variable'
