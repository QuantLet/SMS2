Description : 'Performs a cluster analysis for the US cereal data from the R-package MASS.
On the transformed data will be performed a principal component analysis and a cluster 
analysis employing Euclidean distance with the Ward linkage algorithm. Plots of principal 
components and the dendrogram are presented. After extraction of 3 clusters, the principal
components with the 3 clusters (denoted by different colours) are shown'
