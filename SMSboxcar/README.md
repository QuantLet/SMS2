Description: Computes boxplots for the mileage of US, Japanese and European company headquarters from car data, respectively. Evidently, for the US the core of observations have lowest values of mileage compared with Japan and the EU. However, the US shows larger variation in the data. All boxplots show rather unsymmetric boxes, the medians (red solid lines) and means (black dashed lines) are not overlapping.
