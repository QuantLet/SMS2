Description: 'Computes Flury faces for two normal samples: x~N1(0,1) and y~N2(2,1) permutating over the right and left face line, and over the right and left darkness of hair. Up to 36 dimensional data can be represented using this technique. The difference in the mean between both samples is illustrated in different face size. Matlab allows a specification of only one parameter per coloumn of variable.'
