Published in: Multivariate Statistics: Exercises and Solutions

Description: â€˜Performs a normalized principal component analysis for the athletic data set (athletic.mat) which contains national athletic records of 55 countries in eight  disciplines (100m, 200m, 400m, 800m, 1500m, 5km, 10km and marathon). Evidently, for different length of tracks different times were measured. Thus, the data is normalized before running the PC analysis. Eigenvalues, eigenvectors, screeplot, the first three principal components (PCs) and the correlation of the first two PCs with the original variables are shown as results.'

Keywords: 'NPCA, dimension reduction, eigenvalues, eigenvectors, multi-dimensional, multivariate, normalization, pca, principal-components, scaling, screeplot, transformation'
