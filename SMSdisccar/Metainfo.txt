Name of Quantlet: SMSdisccar

Published in: Multivariate Statistics: Exercises and Solutions

Description: 'Demonstrates the ML discrimination rule for car data set which encloses different variables for the three regions, the US, Europe and Japan. The apparent error rate (APER), defined as the percentage of misclassified observations is (11 + 8 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 5)/79 = 41.89 per cent. It seems that the rule is not particularly good since we have less than 60 chance of correct classification. Moreover, this estimate is based on the observations which were used to construct the discriminant rule and it might be way too optimistic.'

Keywords: 'ML rule, discriminant analysis, aper, discrimination'
